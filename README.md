## Django Learning Documentation :snake:

### I created this project to accompany my evolution process with the Django Framework, I'm following the official Django documentation for my learning https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro, reading every word and line of this documentation I'm managing to evolve every day more because of my background in knowledge of the pure Python language.
### There will probably be other Django projects on my Github as my evolution with the framework improves day by day.
